Purpose
-------

A CSV file that maps bill codes to popular nicknames and keywords.

If you run a service that allows people to search for bills, this would be a great dataset to integrate into your search.

If you want to add entries, fork it, add away, and send a pull request. I'm inclined to take an inclusive approach, since false positives don't seem as bad as simply missing out on finding the bill someone was searching for altogether.
